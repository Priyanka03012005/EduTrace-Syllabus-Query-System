Guidelines for Mini Project,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"Mini project may be carried out in one or more form of following:
Product preparations, prototype development model, fabrication of set-ups, laboratory
experiment development, process modification/development, simulation, software
development, integration of software (frontend-backend) and hardware, statistical data
analysis, creating awareness in society/environment etc.",,,,,,,,,,,
2,"Students shall form a group of 3 to 4 students, while forming a group shall not be allowed
less than three or more than four students, as it is a group activity.",,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Students should do survey and identify needs, which shall be converted into problem
statement for mini project in consultation with faculty supervisor/head
of department/internal committee of faculties.",,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Students shall submit an implementation plan in the form of Gantt/PERT/CPM chart, which
will cover weekly activity of mini projects.",,,,,,,,,,,
5,"A logbook may be prepared by each group, wherein the group can record weekly work
progress, guide/supervisor can verify and record notes/comments.",,,,,,,,,,,
6,"Faculty supervisors may give inputs to students during mini project activity; however, focus
shall be on self-learning.",,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Students under the guidance of faculty supervisor shall convert the best solution into a
working model using various components of their domain areas and demonstrate.",,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The solution to be validated with proper justification and report to be compiled in standard
format of University of Mumbai. Software requirement specification (SRS) documents,
research papers, competition certificates may be submitted as part of annexure to the report.",,,,,,,,,,,
9,,"With the focus on self-learning, innovation, addressing societal/research/innovation
problems and entrepreneurship quality development within the students through the Mini
Projects, it is preferable that a single project of appropriate level and quality be carried out
in two semesters by all the groups of the students. i.e. Mini Project 2 in semesters V and
VI.",,,,,,,,,,
10,,"However, based on the individual students or group capability, with the mentor’s
recommendations, if the proposed Mini Project adhering to the qualitative aspects
mentioned above, gets completed in odd semester, then that group can be allowed to work
on the extension of the Mini Project with suitable improvements/modifications or a
completely new project idea in even semester. This policy can be adopted on a case by
case basis.",,,,,,,,,,
Term Work,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The review/ progress monitoring committee shall be constituted by the heads of departments of
each institute. The progress of the mini project to be evaluated on a continuous basis, based on
the SRS document submitted. minimum two reviews in each semester.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"In continuous assessment focus shall also be on each individual student, assessment based on
individual’s contribution in group activity, their understanding and response to questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Distribution of Term work marks for both semesters shall be as below:,,,Marks 25,,,,,,,,,
1,Marks awarded by guide/supervisor based on logbook,,10,,,,,,,,,
2,Marks awarded by review committee,,10,,,,,,,,,
3,Quality of Project report,,05,,,,,,,,,
"Review / progress monitoring committee may consider following points for assessment based
on either one year or half year project as mentioned in general guidelines",,,,,,,,,,,,
One-year project:,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,"In the first semester the entire theoretical solution shall be made ready, including
components/system selection and cost analysis. Two reviews will be conducted based on
a presentation given by a student group.
First shall be for finalization of problem
Second shall be on finalization of proposed solution of problem.",,,,,,,,,,
2,,"In the second semester expected work shall be procurement of component’s/systems,
building of working prototype, testing and validation of results based on work completed
in an earlier semester.
First review is based on readiness of building working prototype to be conducted.
Second review shall be based on poster presentation cum demonstration of working
model in the last month of the said semester.",,,,,,,,,,
Half-year project:,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,"In this case in one semester students’ group shall complete project in all aspects including,
Identification of need/problem
Proposed final solution
Procurement of components/systems
Building prototype and testing",,,,,,,,,,
2,,"Two reviews will be conducted for continuous assessment,
First shall be for finalization of problem and proposed solution
Second shall be for implementation and testing of solution.",,,,,,,,,,
Mini Project shall be assessed based on following points,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Clarity of problem and quality of literature Survey for problem identification,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Requirement gathering via SRS/ Feasibility Study,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Completeness of methodology implemented,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Design, Analysis and Further Plan",,,,,,,,,,,
5,"Novelty, Originality or Innovativeness of project",,,,,,,,,,,
6,Societal / Research impact,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Effective use of skill set : Standard engineering practices and Project management
standard",,,,,,,,,,,
8,Contribution of an individual’s as member or leader,,,,,,,,,,,
9,Clarity in written and oral communication,,,,,,,,,,,
10,Verification and validation of the solution/ Test Cases,,,,,,,,,,,
11,Full functioning of working model as per stated requirements,,,,,,,,,,,
12,Technical writing /competition/hackathon outcome being met,,,,,,,,,,,
"In one year project (sem V and VI), first semester evaluation may be based on first 10 criteria
and remaining may be used for second semester evaluation of performance of students in mini
projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"In case of half year projects (completing in VI sem) all criteria’s in generic may be considered
for evaluation of performance of students in mini projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Guidelines for Assessment of Mini Project Practical/Oral Examination:,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Report should be prepared as per the guidelines issued by the University of Mumbai.,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"Mini Project shall be assessed through a presentation and demonstration of working model
by the student project group to a panel of Internal and External Examiners preferably from
industry or research organizations having experience of more than five years approved by
the head of Institution.",,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Students shall be motivated to publish a paper/participate in competition based on the
work in Conferences/students competitions.",,,,,,,,,,,

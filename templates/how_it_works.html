    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>
      Syllabus Query System is built to help students quickly find the subject, module, and relevant content 
      for any academic question based on their uploaded syllabus. Here's how it works:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload the Syllabus PDF</strong>: Users begin by uploading the official Third Year 
        Computer Engineering syllabus PDF. The system verifies whether the uploaded file is valid and 
        then extracts and processes all subject and module data from it.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Login to Your Account</strong>: To access the question asking and module detection features,
        you must be logged in. This helps us provide a personalized experience and track your learning progress.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Ask a Question</strong>: After the syllabus is uploaded and you're logged in, you can enter any 
        syllabus-related question into the input box. This could be a theoretical question, a keyword, or 
        even a brief topic phrase.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Module and Subject Detection</strong>:<br/>
        Based on the question, the system detects and displays the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Subject name</li>
          <li>Module number</li>
          <li>Matched module content</li>
          <li>Confidence score</li>
        </ul>
        This helps you know exactly where your question fits within the syllabus.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Video Resource Integration</strong>:<br/>
        To enhance learning, the system fetches relevant educational videos from YouTube based on the 
        detected topic or module. These videos appear alongside the text results.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Search History</strong>:<br/>
        All your queries are saved to your personal history. This allows you to revisit 
        previous questions and track your learning progress over time.
      </li>
    </ol>
